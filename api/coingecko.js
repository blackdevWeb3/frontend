    // Two different explanations for how `stale-while-revalidate` works:

    // https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/caching#stale-while-revalidate
    // This tells our CDN the value is fresh for 10 seconds. If a request is repeated within the next 10 seconds,
    // the previously cached value is still fresh. The header x-vercel-cache present in the response will show the
    // value HIT. If the request is repeated between 1 and 20 seconds later, the cached value will be stale but
    // still render. In the background, a revalidation request will be made to populate the cache with a fresh value.
    // x-vercel-cache will have the value STALE until the cache is refreshed.

    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control
    // The response is fresh for 10s. After 10s it becomes stale, but the cache is allowed to reuse it
    // for any requests that are made in the following 20s, provided that they revalidate the response in the background.
    // Revalidation will make the cache be fresh again, so it appears to clients that it was always fresh during
    // that period â€” effectively hiding the latency penalty of revalidation from them.
    // If no request happened during that period, the cache became stale and the next request will revalidate normally.
